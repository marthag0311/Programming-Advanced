        Check if a given Binary Search Tree (BST) is balanced. A tree is considered balanced if, for every node in the tree, the height difference between its left and right subtree does not exceed 1. The program should read the nodes, construct the BST, and then output 'balanced' if the tree is balanced, or 'not balanced' if it is not.

        Input:
        1 2 3 4 5
        Output:
        not balanced
        Explanation:
        Right of the node: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

        Input:
        10 3 5 2 12 11
        Output:
        balanced
        Explanation:
        Left of the node: 10 -> 3 (-> 2 & -> 5)
        Right of the node: 10 -> 12 (-> 11 & )
