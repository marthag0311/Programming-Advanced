        /*
        Given a string, check if it has balanced brackets. 
        Balanced brackets mean that an opening bracket 
        always has a corresponding closing symbol. You 
        have to deal with the following brackets: ( ), [ ], < > and { }. 
        The output must be one of the following sentences: 
        'Not balanced expression', 'Balanced expression', 
        'Too many close symbols' and 'Too many open symbols'.

        Hint: work with a stack, because the last opened 
        bracket must always be closed first (FILO).

        Try to solve each exercise in different ways, always 
        start from the naive approach first (brute force), and 
        then try to work more efficiently based on what we saw 
        in the lesson! Think what Big(O) could be!

        This {is} a balanced [string]!
        output:
        Balanced expression!
